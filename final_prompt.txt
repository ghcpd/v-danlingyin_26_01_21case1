Prompt
You are a frontend developer.
Your task is to build a complete, runnable frontend application
from scratch based strictly on the specification in input_ui_spec.txt.

This UI Case evaluates:
- Creating a non-trivial app from scratch
- Data aggregation and derived state
- Multi-section UI architecture
- Clean project structure

Requirements:
- Any modern frontend stack is allowed
- Project MUST be runnable locally
- Generate full project files (config + source)
- Use mock data or in-memory state only

Responsibilities:
1. Read input_ui_spec.txt fully
2. Generate a working application
3. Implement all listed features
4. Provide README.md with run instructions

Strict Rules:
- Do NOT output UI descriptions only
- Do NOT invent features not in spec
- Do NOT omit configuration files
